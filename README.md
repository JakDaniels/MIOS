# MIOS
MIOS is a set of control scripts that let you easily run Multiple Instances of Open Simulator.

**Notice** MIOS runs on Linux only!

This is still very much work in progress, but so far it very quickly lets you spin up Instances
of Open Simulator and add new regions to those Instances.
It also monitors the Instances and respawns them if necessary after a crash, or marks them as broken
if the respawn happens too often and too many times.

It does need some initial configuration. These instructions will follow shortly.


Run ./opensim.sh.php --help for more instructions on manipulating Instances once the initial config is done.
